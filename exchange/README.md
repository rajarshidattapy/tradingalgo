# Trading algorithm on exchange
- by hkirat

- Brokers like Zerodha, Groww do not have their own orderbooks (real time supply and demand handling of stocks) for National Stock Exchange (NSE) / Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) stocks. 
- When you place an order on Zerodha, they send it to the NSE. The matching algorithm  coded actually runs on the Exchange's servers, not the Broker's.
- However, if you trade on Binance, Binance is the exchange and they maintain their own private orderbook.
